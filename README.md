# 🔐 Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange in C++

A console-based C++ implementation of the **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm**, one of the fundamental protocols in cryptography. This program allows two users (commonly referred to as Alice and Bob) to securely compute a shared secret key over an insecure channel using modular arithmetic and discrete logarithms.

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Efficient modular exponentiation for large numbers
- 🧪 Validates prime number input for modulus
- 🔁 Loop-based input validation for correct cryptographic parameters
- 👥 Simulates both parties (Alice & Bob) computing the same shared secret independently

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts:** Cryptography, Prime Number Testing, Modular Exponentiation, Key Exchange
- **Libraries Used:** `<iostream>`, `<cmath>`
